yankees exercised restraint long term thinking last winter lost mets johan santana sweepstakes missed playoffs first time since hank steinbrenner getting antsy coffers flush stadium revenue consensus yankees whatever takes land sabathia
indeed heard phrase whatever takes half dozen times
yankees blow every team water financially said national league front office
estimates sabathia deal range five years million high years million executive predicted york could high eight years
yankee love reigned supreme official makes compelling case dodgers
lots money coming books cheap young players filling critical spots official said throw fact club home state potentially rotation spots fill think makes sense
responses angeles dodgers york mets york yankees
manny ramirez made priorities clear national league championship series told reporters plans highest bidder price gasoline said ramirez jokingly according reporters present
actually price gasoline declined recent weeks ramirez seems like good surpass million annually received last free agent deal boston eight years
stock manny late july ramirez vilified dogging boston profile went august september leading dodgers playoffs past cubs division series dodgers owner frank mccourt colletti going tough time saying
manny still offensive force time said assistant times best condition shut risk team turning season around dodgers going hard time explaining fans done
mets need find closer replace billy wagner help rotation might cash ramirez surprisingly none survey respondents mentioned phillies considered potential ramirez suitor manager charlie manuel relationship ramirez team need left fielder burrell leaves town
estimates ramirez contract range three years million high five years million several respondents predicted three years million
responses peavy traded
possible destinations atlanta dodgers louis cubs voter said padres trade peavy anyone give four prospects
padres general manager kevin towers seems awfully motivated legitimate starter team going contend mandate keep payroll line jake peavy could bring several promising young players return
based seen sure sounds like deal said national league scout quite smoke
braves popular choice number reasons aggressive suitor enough young talent satisfy padres even digging deep system acquire mark teixeira year diego tough time prying loose pitcher tommy hanson tearing arizona fall league year outfield prospect jason heyward atlanta cupboard
peavy trade clause probably waive select clubs cubs interest could hinge whether ryan dempster returns leaves free agency astros dodgers cardinals also peavy desirable list houston louis match diego talentwise
padres move peavy place prefer either decline waive trade clause money sweeten deal peavy contract diego guarantees million next four years padres million club option

questions matt holliday ability career base slugging percentage coors field road clubs talked dowd holliday season impression rockies bowled trade
sure anyone gives necessary package year scott boras client home road split said executive
dowd nice jason jennings trade years acquiring willy taveras taylor buchholz jason hirsh houston success boston tampa colorado bringing young players along past years team rush move prospects rentals days
responses lowe burnett
derek lowe ryan dempster burnett exercises clause generally regarded best starting pitchers market sabathia conventional wisdom right wrong dempster wind back cubs would executives prefer
burnett years younger lowe high octane stuff established career highs year innings starts posted record superior competition american league east
burnett found nice comfort zone toronto slid behind halladay blue jays rotation excellent working relationship pitching coach brad arnsberg although burnett ruled york boston markets executives think might want give strong consideration staying toronto
lowe turned june lithe athletic appear disabled list majors stuff year good ever said national league still lowe ground ball ball ratio worst since rookie year
since lowe closer next team could always consider using relief role road needed sinkerballer might better equipped radar readings decline tick
choice comes matter taste prefer older safer choice younger performs like game
take lowe said front office bother much burnett entire injury portfolio
burnett mile said executive last year deal whereas lowe deal close
responses burrell abreu
burrell years younger hits power averaged homers rbis nine seasons phillies
bobby abreu turns spring training higher career base percentage burrell career stolen bases burrell five
abreu homers past seasons come yankee stadium burrell beneficiary citizens bank park cozy dimensions might think since park opened five years burrell home runs philadelphia road
like troy glaus said american league executive hits hits matter playing
although abreu regarded within industry slightly better defensively neither player much bargain glove statistician john dewan plus minus system ranked abreu second worst right fielder game ahead colorado brad hawpe burrell second worst left fielder game ahead minnesota delmon young
least abreu moves better said national league executive burrell looks running glass
difference burrell prone white stretches followed prolonged slumps abreu consistent producer yankees hitting coach kevin long said earlier year bobby always going something basket might walk stolen base extra base three
burrell made star team break slumped average break first time vanished extended period
responses says condition griffey willing accept reduced role doubt team would commit everyday bats executive said
potential destinations seattle tampa oakland atlanta york mets chicago white sure
griffey three home runs bats joining white deadline trade cincinnati difficulty covering ground center field since come light playing legs griffey left knee drained three times last season twice cincinnati chicago underwent arthroscopic surgery minor repairs last month
seattle obvious choice since would allow griffey come full circle complete career heartwarming note griffey could play right field first base help replace raul ibanez offense provide bridge outfield prospects greg halman michael saunders generate goodwill team badly need
question jack zduriencik make call organizational decision
seems upper management makes calls imagine pretty good ticket sales said general manager
oakland merits mention billy beane seems soft spot accomplished hitters twilight careers taken plunge frank thomas mike piazza mike sweeney recent years mixed results
tampa also could make sense cliff floyd shoulder injury prompts call quits griffey lives orlando might energized playing alongside upton talented young players rays roster griffey career hits might need play three years reach milestone
griffey agent brian goldberg never hard liners negotiations junior might willing deal million range incentives believe first time griffey year career free agent

mago workout cueto
look mago told boston scouts brought second coming pedro martinez
cueto threw enough impress boston scouts offered little johnny father told even could give much money




trying discipline maintain delivery thought process throughout course outing want consistency reliability pitches


point almost everyone involved gotten desperate night mago called reds scout luis baez
prospect mago told
baez authority sign players luckily though johnny almaraz reds latin american scouting director time dominican republic catch almaraz flight next cueto would appear early morning workout

baez cueto throw several bullpen sessions time sent reports almaraz shortly almaraz decided sign cueto based baez reports pitches early morning workout
told cueto thought could major leaguer quickly baez said
three minor league seasons cueto rookie year reds cueto many expected make jump fatigued allow recent study fangraphs noted cueto swinging strike rate dropped percent percent slider break much seemingly signs tired pitcher
reds catcher ramon hernandez said times last year cueto whole body appeared fatigued shoulders slumped hung limp head bowed
fifth inning starts noticed pitch anymore hernandez said
likely cueto size caused tire study glenn flesig head researcher american sports medicine institute home noted athletic orthopedist james andrews determined pitcher size dictate fatigue
difference short tall groups regarding much load elbow related tommy john injury risk shoulder related rotator cuff risk wrote fleisig mail load stretching front shoulder related front shoulder capsule injury risk actually less shorter group taller group thus data support theory shorter pitchers produce greater loads injury risk arms
likely cueto arrive spring training camp adequate shape despite pitched much winter days cueto spindly pitcher reds signed instead carries slight paunch spoils success
almost impossible relate difficult person comes poor country handle excess presented cueto making effort better shape
shortly throwing bullpen session week cueto spent time reds trainers working medicine ball finished exercise cueto hill near playing fields
working little extra year said former reds pitcher mario soto roving instruction spring
part extra work includes pantomiming price

workouts week ended cueto chapman leaving reds many playing fields spring training complex
cueto immediately turned toward group fans began signing autographs chapman headed toward clubhouse cueto signing also headed toward fans signed autographs
cueto leader perhaps truly grown

last week reader joshua packard sent following
think good player
think value knowing player fact jose cruz essentially player last several years give value call predictability accounted

couple answers

yeah think cruz good player superstar everybody thought would become back know minor league numbers never really suggested would become great major leaguer third pick draft switch hitter pretty swing people plenty monster numbers minors never excited
course expectations giants signed cruz mail messages basic gist excited
excited corner outfielders available giants probably best left giants needed replace production reggie sanders last season games sanders homers scored runs knocked batted slugging
shandler projection cruz includes slugging percentage cruz signed giants play best pitcher park national league numbers quite good give giants essentially sanders gave
whether value consistency think organization sophisticated enough notice
mean sophisticated organization estimates many games want coming season figure many runs need score many allow armed figures start building roster least modicum precision stands reason know individual player perform precise
said know cruz particularly consistent granted essentially similar playing time years injuries ineffectiveness context rest career still probably true cruz know going giants good player make favorites national league west season
robert person
back card
june robert threw five shutout innings expos supported effort grand slam three homer career hitter time team pitcher record
perhaps goes without saying less said person pitching better
junior spivey



marginal prospect national league star eyeblink junior ernest birth round pick arizona first draft
true round draft pick also true probably better round draft picks ever meet sure notion marginal prospect eyeblink becoming star spivey first season professional batted drew walks games third season batted drew walks stole bases games
season john sickels wrote spivey regarded prospect albeit marginal
oops guess marginal least
know best minor league season spivey spent disabled list various injuries play well spent backs consider spivey history give diamondbacks credit realizing good player waiting come though doubt even fantasized become star first season regular
lance berkman game subset
back card lists major leagues last year berkman fourth list first national league found particularly interesting though next nlers list albert pujols burrell
pujols ever suffer sophomore jinx exceptionally rare rookie year play well next season exactly pujols
burrell turned star nobody really seems noticed maybe life phillies though bobby abreu certainly famous think going change though phillies score runs dethrone braves people notice
athletics consecutive games
flipped coin times odds coming heads flip thus oakland game winning streak august september truly million games miguel tejada homer single bottom ninth blowing lead oakland straight scott hatteberg homer bottom ninth athletics final triumph broke record consecutive victories
quite million excellent team last year remember games competition game winning streak something less excellent beat royals five times tigers three times indians four times also beat blue jays twice white three times twins three times games wins three team finished winning record
want figure actual odds want encourage think something less million
jose vizcaino
around long room words statistics makes writing harder write jose vizcaino already written
next month brighter note last season first since vizcaino finished bats precise also last season career best slugging percentage vizcaino could counted another season like astros might well dump julio lugo give vizcaino full time

trot nixon
want consistent since reaching majors good nixon slugging percentages look like
said numbers misleading nixon rarely allowed left handed pitchers consistency since actually represents improvement posted slugging percentages moving full time role bats still waiting season though shandler thinks might come nixon hitting balls fewer ground balls second half homers slugging percentage good stuff understand shandler says could brainer
rafael furcal



everybody going together birthday
according furcal player card espn born october according scouting notebook published sporting news furcal born october
topps company like atlanta braves topps continues maintain furcal born funny braves continue foist fiction upon suspecting public maybe think keep repeating somehow come true shortstop somehow return many growth years ahead
javier lopez
jose cruz finding lopez pack allows correct error made last time wrote braves catcher either column chat maybe excoriated john schuerholz exercising million option javier lopez contract
wrong team option player option course lopez agent saltiest crackers world exercise
instead excoriated schuerholz giving lopez option first place

office commissioner existed nearly years nine overview focusing impact game
kenesaw mountain landis
described writer flinty colorful often arbitrary landis baseball first commissioner still almost measure greatest
still young landis earned degree chicago union school long thanks largely political connections landis brothers indiana congressmen appointment federal judge quickly became known quirky newsworthy justice granted many better known decisions overturned higher courts federal league challenged national american leagues field also courts arguing reserve clause essentially bound national american league players employers forever illegal landis heard case nothing federal league eventually went
made landis friends high baseball places lords baseball desperate restore public confidence sport wake black scandal turned landis lead three member board control landis demanded absolute power something close
among landis first acts famous summer though none black convicted crime landis suspended forever saying regardless outcome juries player throws ball game player entertains proposals promises throw game player sits conference bunch crooked players ways means throwing games discussed promptly tell club ever play professional baseball
single decision landis might done sport anyone else ever certainly landis never anything important free number minor leaguers efforts prevent major league teams establishing farm systems noble effort good cause also doomed fail
landis blamed delaying integration major leagues truth owners want black players majors landis likely even landis died could prevented branch rickey bringing jackie robinson national league
happy chandler
chandler governor kentucky senator impressed lords world public pronouncements relationship baseball american society landis death owners needed commissioner chandler happily accepted resigned senate seat
chandler suspended dodgers manager durocher alleged ties various shady characters spring chandler deal controversy surrounding jackie robinson promotion dodgers opposed nearly every owner number ballplayers chandler later took credit smoothing aside account little evidence jules tygiel wrote baseball great experiment jackie robinson legacy best describe chandler role endorsement abstinence chandler claims posterity notwithstanding appears player historic events
perhaps smartest thing chandler ever said owners want real commissioner year resigned bosses refused give contract extension later served governor kentucky
ford frick
sportswriter frick took president national league position really meant something held taking commissioner chandler sitting hands frick supposedly told cardinals players threatened strike jackie robinson allowed play strike care wrecks league years rebellious redbirds backed
fairness noted frick commissioner never chance like also avoided making decisions whenever possible timers talk frick tenure help remember standard reaction various disputes league matter
frick much notable exception roger maris threatened babe ruth single season record home runs frick served ruth favorite ghostwriter time something famously calling asterisk placed next maris name record books maris achieved feat game season opposed ruth game season famously asterisk never actually appeared instead records listed notations season lengths
william eckert
spike eckert retired army general made significant ruling significantly changed course least franchise history
february atlanta braves signed pitcher seaver contract close however eckert voided contract baseball season already started making seaver ineligible sign professional contract meanwhile ncaa ruled seaver ineligible play signed professional contract valid
course made seaver without team eckert made another ruling team willing match atlanta offer would equal shot seaver three teams phillies indians mets entered derby april eckert reached plucked piece paper read york mets seaver pitched hitter first minor league game spot major league roster next spring course rest history
shortly eckert term commissioner seaver case resolved sporting news editorialized
think seeing eckert take positive action matters gets feel
writers greeted appointment wisecracks unknown soldier changing tune seen florida camps revising estimates became three star general
eckert home commissioner struck either
probably nicest thing anybody every wrote eckert tenure late labor problems horizon owners asked eckert resign three years since seaver case eckert done allowed anything still remembered passing year unknown soldier becomes unknown
bowie kuhn
ford frick became identified phrase justified passivity kuhn became identified phrase justified activity best interests game using rationale kuhn banned mickey mantle willie mays worked greeters casinos voided deals sent various oakland superstars rich teams exchange huge time sums money
kuhn particularly friend players often remembered simply tool owners true owners salary kuhn frequently clashed owner charlie finley suspended george steinbrenner pled guilty illegal campaign contributions turner tampered potential free agent gary matthews
baseball first strikes came kuhn tenure might fairly criticized failing effectively guide owners dealings players association head marvin miller kuhn also remembered allowing postseason games played night stubbornly refused wear coat attending games matter frigid temperature nobody really liked kuhn might mean well commissioner could
peter ueberroth
ueberroth money appropriate discussing tenure commissioner list figures million billion
winters following seasons surprisingly offers made free agent players eventually surprise explained encouragement ueberroth owners simply agreed sign free agents clearly violation collective bargaining agreement governed relationship owners players eventually owners forced million players free agents seasons question owners ever caught thing triple damages
happier note commissioner ueberroth sport quite accomplished shaking money tree playing game ueberroth lifted kuhn suspensions mantle mays ueberroth major league baseball greatly increased number corporate sponsorships licensing monies also grew beyond owner happiest imagination significantly ueberroth brokered pair gigantic four year contracts espn together added nearly billion owners coffers
bart giamatti
giamatti tenure commissioner lasted exactly days typical baseball name three commissioners pretty good chance giamatti take three spots
pete rose
giamatti replaced ueberroth commissioner served years president national league reds manager pete rose shoving match umpire dave pallone giamatti suspended rose days longest suspension manager since chandler suspended durocher later unfortunately rose came giamatti life
ueberroth still commissioner learned rose associating bookies might large sums money baseball games ueberroth hired attorney john dowd investigate rose giamatti national league president ueberroth anointed successor involved every step process dowd submitted report giamatti replaced ueberroth
dowd report seemed conclusive rose definitely hung unsavory characters certainly baseball games grounds year suspension quite probably reds games grounds permanent suspension rose time managing reds
various gaffes nearly parties involved giamatti explicitly suspend rose gambling rose signed agreement stipulated permanent suspension organized baseball include clause nothing agreement shall deemed either admission denial peter edward rose
nevertheless giamatti answering question media said concluded rose baseball
reds

exactly week announcing rose decision giamatti suffered massive heart attack died
vincent
upon taking commissioner giamatti created post deputy commissioner best friend vincent giamatti unexpected death vincent immediately named commissioner
vincent though impact sport particularly significant likely remembered last commissioner completely pockets owners alone remember fondly
selig
possible exception landis commissioner made larger mark game selig nobody activist selig watch major league baseball
added franchises
played regular season games mexico puerto rico japan
scheduled first time regular season games teams different leagues
expanded number divisions league three
added wild card postseason also includes three rounds including best five division series league
selig would changes watch also favored said favor never sure international draft radical realignment many teams would switched leagues contraction teams prior season various reasons none things past talking stage give selig credit obvious flaws afraid change
selig legacy goes beyond changes advocated selig truly redefined whereas commissioner served least occasionally intermediary players owners settler disputes today commissioner jobs essentially serve public face find common ground owners stand said getting lords baseball agree something like herding cats generally performed stronger owners walter malley instance days many owners selling teams years thanks loophole herding cats commissioner baseball never seen another herder like selig

remember andre dawson
answer easy dusty baker
nobody played sheer guts knees longer hawk said baker chicago cubs manager could bigger numbers time player
dawson hall famer
kirby puckett hall tony perez hall gary carter ryne sandberg ozzie smith hall dawson needs every player five although comparing apples oranges cases undervalued hall fame ballot year barry bonds home runs bret boone drove runs
time many voters take second look give dawson love always gave fans teammates clubs paid even giving chicago cubs blank check exchange services
remember dawson came montreal expos oversized center fielder rookie year skills still many remember peak skills montreal triple threat plate bases right field
remember career limped hard watch seasons boston florida marlins however vivid memories dawson came chicago cubs
cubs dawson valuable player award helped team national league east title putting york mets dominance even getting best dawson
struggle francisco giants championship series teammates peers understood daily battle went onto field knees orthopedic surgeon could love born good ones course still left florida destroyed playing reckless abandon concrete like artificial turf montreal olympic stadium
maybe tragic irreversible glaucoma ended puckett career seasons reason give dawson benefit doubt terms hall fame candidacy
eligible player ever collected many hits without becoming hall famer claim dawson almost certainly pass harold baines hits goes onto ballot year
despite receiving mail trainer rooms whirlpools dawson hated strong enough word really lineup pushed onto field establish marks come durability
dawson good athlete davey johnson started center field eric davis left star game first player ever together consecutive seasons finished double figure home stolen base totals piled extra base hits consecutive seasons becoming sixth name list included henry aaron stan musial willie mays honus wagner
picture perfect enshrined hall last summer sandberg took time campaign dawson whose free agent signing energized cubs franchise grown dormant since unexpected trip national league championship series


player baseball history worked harder suffered better andre dawson sandberg said best ever seen watched last place team unbelievable thing ever seen baseball right natural field bases every hope stand
sandberg comment natural course shot jose canseco generation illegally enhanced often dimensional sluggers numbers mark mcgwire sammy sosa bonds others diminished least reflection time career statistics hitters early including dawson rice
much bump guys voting remains seen
dawson gained votes first year ballot fourth year electorate also grew span gain might seem percent percent meant moved votes votes short percent requirement election
whole minds change canseco book richard nixon moment experienced rafael palmeiro enough thinking well maybe reasoning like dawson knees beyond repair

five time star time home leader player teams braves mentioned cosmo kramer steinbrenner rant
denying notable player problem comes investigate high rose peers best players time rising tide raise mind consider following
mcgriff never considered three players league according voting finished fourth placed eight three times instantly candidacy richie ashburn finished twice times remains huge blow credentials
similarity scores compare mcgriff mccovey stargell rely numbers take account players played mccovey stargell hall famers thirtysomething homers year high offensive totals considerably harder come mcgriff started pitching heavy still padded numbers
many first basemen hall mcgriff career coincided perfectly mark mcgwire rafael palmeiro frank thomas jeff bagwell players retire better qualifications mcgriff even counting eddie murray arrived thome delgado giambi helton group followed even grant mcgriff fifth best first baseman debatable sound like hall famer
amateur scientists thrive hall fame arguments brewing logic specious elixirs almost every player made look cooperstown worthy look category mcgriff case tell home runs dimaggio mickey mantle even higher harmon killebrew world series rings williams ernie banks combined went deep times
basically comes much stock number terms punching someone hall fame ticket mcgriff finished home runs conversation would traction whatsoever statistical understanding allow number dictate player value legacy things learned statistics past years mean mean homers mean enough anymore even

team wins first road games first espn look reasons
team goes nearly month half without holding lead road game mission look trends tendencies
even curses
brings mysterious case houston astros
espn investigators finally uncovered real reason astros much trouble finding bright side road
curse deshaies
deshaies admitted confronted recently harsh truth bambino goat
case familiar deshaies appears surface basic mild mannered quick witted always incisive astros broadcaster
delve beneath theoretically innocent veneer find description would raise anyone eyebrow season like
broadcasts team road games
questions
amazingly many folks either inside outside astros little universe caught seemingly inescapable connection
imagine deshaies chuckled done article going change
well probably help folks
noticed though larry dierker astros former manager also essentially platoons deshaies astros broadcast team
dierker home games deshaies road games
surprisingly team record broadcaster booth looks slightly different dierker thursday four games deshaies games
explains recent home game road record topic came dierker help
know said maybe problem deshaies pretty good
whereupon astros went else lost meant deshaies reported dierk immediately apologize gods baseball
gods baseball deshaies needs poor went three half weeks point april without broadcasting single astros easy
still never envisioned worthy curse named helpfully brought face face reality
really bought whole thing curses said thing takes hold might become little proactive exonerating
well look back deshaies past search previous curse indicators
years pitching leagues seven astros strikeout record even nolan ryan never sept deshaies became pitcher since strike first eight hitters game streak electrifying manager tommy lasorda pinch pitcher third inning stop
curse like
deshaies finish career straight seasons including described poster pitching think thousand pitchers worse career deshaies sure pitch curse
certainly shown prior curse tendencies broadcaster either last year astros even went road also made playoffs five first eight seasons behind mike
thing firmly established ever found resemblance deshaies george babe ruth although deshaies confessed used killer bambino home trot college
time home list deshaies calculated ahead plus four little league
fact deshaies official anti bambino offensively babe holds time record extra base hits season deshaies hand holds time record career bats without getting extra base hits
safe deshaies caught curse fabled bambino
goat deshaies said eater drinker goat products even though admitted stop occasionally goat cheese fudge haines city spring training seem
billy goat tavern chicago deshaies acknowledged maybe caught exposed curse germ guess limited exposure
point though goal longer find curse came figure simple challenge either
england tried digging bambino piano bottom pond deshaies broadcasting memorabilia could unearth would scorebook recycling center houston find guess said real enticing thought
back playing career deshaies recalled astros lost diego browsing bookstore came upon book witchcraft thought might help snap curse jack murphy stadium
remember specific twigs gather said although might gathered exact twigs separate twigs light fire burner burned turner turned everything good come wood
would last time actually curse breaking business
keeps forgetting pack twigs days either come incantation said watch bewitched summer
would seem trickier curse bust mainly deshaies said sure whether breaking curse breaking curse team road mean road kind vague notion
figures could always burn road portion pocket schedule would involve intricate scissor artisanship
particularly radical strategy could switching roles dierker working home games
thought absolutely deshaies said fear people started really believe dierk went road started dead meat
deshaies said tinge sadness normally chipper voice legitimately would curse risk willing take
leave decide maybe curse coincidence astros five last seven road
maybe thing curses would even goat hook
call espn business accusing convicting enacting salem witchcraft trials facts make
convincing particular facts want feel free great human hook deserves

nobody loves good trade rumor rumblings grumblings
obsessing last weeks chad qualls next destination amazing stuff apparently happening field yeah shocking know true
safe attention actual baseball rumor central want direct attention five field stories need follow last months could lead five place players traveled lifetimes
could votto triple crown still question leads league batting leading homers adam dunn passed wednesday column votto trails landed disabled list ryan howard eight


stats





traditional triple crown work votto still pace modern triple crown championed friend posnanski leads league batting base percentage slugging percentage hang become ninth last half century decimal point version triple crown
even reds bopper either trifecta double crown votto chasing would still land cool company
rare player legs triple crown exceptionally rare legs votto best shot homers batting average season
barry bonds never willie mays never stan musial never year anyway fact three ever williams johnny mize babe ruth good group historic group votto excellent position join keep posted
speaking could triple crown regret announce looking increasingly unlikely cabrera going hanging carl yastrzemski frank robinson secretariat column cabrera seven behind jose bambino bautista homered twice since magglio ordonez went july


stats





cabrera could still join robinson though secretariat another cool group keeps
cabrera leads extra base hits also hitting meaning second batting race josh hamilton fellow whose average points higher previous career high nearly points higher lifetime average
hamilton returns earth cabrera goes lead american league hitting also leading extra base hits putting amazing company five players categories since world four robinson mickey mantle williams triple crown year
lead league extra base hits without leading homers still winning batting title feat seen years last tony oliva back snuffy stirnweiss
oddly happened four times since rockies matt holliday todd helton plus albert pujols derrek done since hank aaron
still fantastic challenging feat watched cabrera swing lately know well within reach matter heck within reach
fashionable days dump rbis understand reason readily acknowledge baseball history good baseball massively overrated statistics


stats





somebody needs drive runs matter think stat howard dominated like nobody seen years
stuck phillies disabled list least next weeks probably lost shot join ruth gehrig ranks drove least runs five straight seasons howard lost chance join group almost impressive
rbis tied prince fielder title last year leading year make finish line lead despite stint limbo would become fourth player since rbis became official stat lead league three straight seasons
others george foster medwick rogers hornsby ohbytheway holliday gotten play game drive bonus runs howard would working fourth title
subplots need consider first chances howard leading league despite stay well recently last thursday lead category already shrunken three easy time returns phillies close least theoretically getting full lineup back field first time since many many opportunities stretch
brings element discussion opportunities granted achieve feat need many opportunities howard arrived home plate runners base player according baseball prospectus also finished third sixth respectively department previous years team feat almost much individual feat
still make meaningless achievement know sabermetricians agree particularly year phillies lineup crumbled around howard important team ever
also ranks second league percent runners driven second base fourth percent runners driven period among hitters least plate appearances runs scoring accident
wrong asking anyone worship rbis merely suggesting ignore either like everything sport proper perspective complicated
right lincecum dominant season agree case noticed four blown saves bullpen strikeouts innings exactly john benschoten either


stats





thing lincecum continues despite slightly less cooperation fastball make poor hitters swing miss leads league strikeouts ahead halladay
regardless start goes though lincecum remains tremendous position something great ones lead league strikeouts third year
lincecum outwhiffs league year would join randy johnson warren spahn pitchers since world least three straight seasons three plus johnny vander meer done since four dizzy dean done since
happened often reason lincecum done first three full seasons counting rookie year made starts feat know rare percent sure rare
know lefty grove feller know nolan ryan johan santana first three seasons full time starters though full time leaguers tough time coming definitive list feel free submit nominees uselessinfodept yahoo
meantime idea long lincecum career last exactly many pitches take flies shoulder watch inimitable thing proved still something special
talk great pitchers probably takes little long wainwright name could change could ever


stats





know odds anybody winning pitching triple crown year pitcher especially league lincecum halladay josh johnson ubaldo jimenez among luminaries check handy dandy stat sheet find wainwright real shot
pitching triple crown lead league wins strikeouts case noticed wainwright second wins behind jimenez third points behind johnson fifth strikeouts behind halladay sure question
division play layman terms post koufax four pitchers particular triple crown jake peavy randy johnson dwight gooden steve carlton joined santana pedro martinez roger clemens guessing heard
realistic think wainwright pull first inclination probably fast
plays heck team wins keep coming leads major leagues nearly last full seasons dating sept reason think going explode averaging whiffs nine innings higher rate halladay seven innings start going pile well strikeouts
going predict wainwright going predict either predict total assurance watching many plotlines make last months intriguing waiting next jose guillen trade rumor
owning owners meeting coming minnesota next week consult vladimir shpunt know already contentious topic session

heck rangers allowed many negotiable dollars payroll trading deadline
originally estimated last weekend rangers added million four major july deals turned high

left handed hitters fuentes season best rate left hander market hitters left right batted places free agent charts ahead even mariano rivera fuentes strikeout rate nine innings ranked second among free agent left handers
might better many people giving credit

gonzalez

adrian even adrian gonzalez health questions probably shot padres going trade winter gonzalez recent surgery clean labrum area right shoulder downgrades odds considerably least
gonzalez told diego media corps week ready play spring training clubs hearing talk even swing march call great incentive teams charge next weeks trade three time prospects
think complicates padres said front office concern team always keep trade deadline suppose starts slow gets even harder real return
clubs floating talk think means shot gonzalez discount good luck expect padres argue serious injury serious surgery gonzalez healthy enough start every game july given kind dollars chasing next winter stretch question either health motivation heads biggest season life
nevertheless last time hear adrian gonzalez labrum first multi homer game

zambrano

northern exposure sudden cubs seem less inclined deal players like kosuke fukudome carlos zambrano months credit mike quade effect
much difference quade make well cubs went games managed going final games piniella managed changes show standings
scouts followed cubs said young players bullpen crew particular relax perform without high strung piniella around fukudome also different hitting walks strikeouts hitting
needed change scenery said executive without going anywhere
meanwhile hearing cubs gotten feelers zambrano availability finish suspension eliminated sense urgency cubs might move bunch money
teams report cubs would still talk zambrano full trade clause salaries million million coming next years plus vesting million option
cubs said official team like last year moving milton bradley done kind move
matt keep reading hearing matt kemp trade rumors official team kicked tires reports trading matt kemp reason obviously kemp talent irreplaceable another kemp great relationship manager mattingly dodgers betting year
dodgers would talk could fill pitching left field hole first baseman james loney need save money want move loney fast could replace free agent first basemen

taking charge playing second base always good going back balls samuel says center field knowing playing knowing balls guys could toughest things going outfield middle infielder camped ball call center fielder charge
happened call balls early thought speed could think crap
much thinking used think hitting samuel laughs want much time think tell guys take hitting guys still found instead anticipating situations words surprised
long could feel legs getting weak samuel recalls running back forth dugout spring training somebody line drive right center field went right fielder tried kick gear pulled hamstring could coming
second base different short quick steps running back everybody balls right fielder balls left fielder back constantly something rest running times ball leadoff next inning back said hold need break

taking charge take charge says gerry hunsicker probably first time since cesar cedeno left houston astros center fielder take charge outfield think aggressive communicate guys wings


thinking time ready biggio says years going season baseball always thinking coming infield thinking second base infield little older maybe good much thinking
still thinking involved level infield make think every situation fast first third throw third different situations trying think pretty much whole aspect outfield think
running yeah long biggio chuckles noticed already definitely longer going knew offseason prepared legs prepared body running miles week knowing
maybe biggest difference though samuel biggio samuel admits never wanted move first place could think year would take back second base biggio different stage career clearly different priorities
help ease move center coaxed year million extension owner drayton mclane leaves signed main selling point wanted retire astro
baseball love game biggio says game everything opportunity spend last years playing last contract money staying finishing career many people play whole career organization want
remember kirby puckett think minnesota twins remember robin yount think milwaukee brewers remember mattingly think yankees honor played whole career team good thing baseball happens wish happened


well script laid happen happen successfully biggio make move work
batted since base percentage slid last year stole bases since tearing swiped total past seasons
nevertheless chance right right place right time hunsicker says looking center fielder years
since cedeno terry puhl tony scott omar moreno jerry mumphrey billy hatcher gerald young steve finley derek bell brian hunter richard hidalgo lance berkman biggio turn
infield used catching balls palm glove biggio says outfield glove still catching palm know long stays care

hamels good fastball throws anywhere pitch good movement often pinpoint command combination velocity movement location much ball hitters handle year hamels good fastball though curve changeup average pitches mixes well mechanics clean repeats consistently efficient young pitcher excellent presence mound hamels still physically projectable could another inch plus pounds frame would likely boost fastball even
performance
south atlantic league provided little competition hamels went circuit like knife butter innings lakewood allowed hits fanned left handed hitters managed average righties florida state league stiffer challenge still held five starts clearwater though walked many people combined innings struck walking giving hits marks charts
health record
hamels broke pitching high school sophomore injury healed properly type break ruined careers dave dravecky browning tony saunders doctors effects phillies understandably cautious invested million dollars signing bonus given undeniable talent would tragic player team gets hurt know enough sorts injuries make sort direct medical historical judgment seems unlikely phillies team would invest actual doubt odds health issues derail career standard elbow shoulder woes attack young pitchers nothing sophomore break
