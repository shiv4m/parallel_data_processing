sure nets thinking gave carter huge million contract summer carter game already decline jersey chances competing title looked slim midseason jason kidd gone richard jefferson shipped draft night carter star left proud franchise clear nets rebuilding clearing space summer carter could provide stabilizing force young team sure owner bruce ratner wants carter average million year mentor lottery team
obvious vince might lakers looking traditional small forward nets would love make carter odom swap would clear another huge chunk salary books terrible contract making lakers everyone else think twice lakers interested clippers might
swap carter cuttino mobley thomas would help nets costs give clippers better shot competitive another expect nets president thorn work magic find good deal originally acquired carter
many scratched heads summer chicago john paxson trade kirk hinrich drafting derrick rose pick
though always agreed paxson thinking clearly traded hinrich free agent gordon would much better negotiating position bulls knowing want lose backcourt veterans summer
gordon called bluff signed year qualifying offer paxson decision make
hand chances losing gordon next season hits unrestricted free agency high gordon happy bulls negotiated probably going change hand gordon contract demands fairly outrageous reason sign trade talk league wanted gordon asking maybe many free agent suitors thinks
case likely want change scenery bulls sound willing give though trade consent trade long sent team room playing time doubt object

walsh tried move randolph eddy curry instead luck late january february randolph curry roster walsh going include sweeten package steep price mere chance lure lebron york caves pays knicks basically stuck crappy team think walsh knicks long suffering contingent much patience
bobcats surprised people drafted point guard augustin lottery bobcats quietly shopping felton ever since larry brown took coach
neither augustin felton taken preseason word charlotte augustin sooner later going point guard charlotte felton heading restricted free agency next summer look bobcats something return felton never superstar starting point guard always easy come

schultz ultimately decided disliked payton liked mason like abraham willing sacrifice beginning downward spiral
took deeper turn summer team became embroiled contract negotiations rashard lewis point always model citizen quiet respectful professional
schultz accompanied sonics negotiating team texas meet lewis mother agents sides lewis baseball pulled eyes never looked schultz never spoke something schultz took personal affront sign disrespect
business things schultz would later referring like minded negotiations regularly undertakes head starbucks

coach nelson experimenting basketball laboratory mixing various lineup concoctions together performs best antidote powerful opponents right nellie back playing small ball tactic used past milwaukee golden state
nelson plays without center mainly none sends forwards dirk nowitzki antoine walker three perimeter players steve nash michael finley rookie marquis daniels force opponents unconventional matchups especially care team undersized going play kind zone defense anyway even standard predictable zone nellie zone take different shapes sometimes becoming switching sometimes even play straight double team post players ball basket area
three reasons nellie first loves tinker personnel second prides able find unconventional ways overcome obstacles third wants
result trial error maneuverings another season chance nelson first championship ring present mavs tied memphis fifth place western conference going tuesday home game grizzlies game would probably give mavs first round playoff matchup lakers loss would drop probable matchup sacramento nellie would prefer latter
diagnosis
small ball mavs best chance shawn bradley enough game play center contending team nelson second option foot danny fortson tough rebounder lacks size battle bigs west three forward lineup walker nowitzki antawn jamison defend well enough contain front line positions
small ball actually logical lineup nellie employ hopes advance playoffs provides team highest potential score makes opponents change style play mavs need outscore opponents uptempo game need push ball upcourt create open shots perimeter drives hoop good style style creates disruptive environment opponents thinking transition defense even execute offense
nash perfect game plan extremely quick advancing ball dribble great court vision finds open teammates transition dangerous point land finishes basket array balance control shots
nowitzki also excellent either deep close walker passes well open court finishes consistently hoop although erratic perimeter shooter finley great clutch shooter almost anywhere court daniels surprise skill maturity
bench nellie goes jamison great sixth role another rookie josh howard like daniels plays like veteran rookie eduardo najera also available toughness hustle front line rotation travis best gives team veteran leadership backcourt
mavs lead league points scored game rank second orlando points allowed nash said best need play best offense score points need adequate defense
cure
mavs going easy playoffs team chances advancing best sacramento matchup pairs teams place high priority offense quick paced offensive tempo shooter delight point totals level teams nelson hoping matchup
mavs chances success diminish probable opponent lakers shaquille neal karl malone unmatched nellie defensive ploys kobe bryant operate freedom

racial resentment comes territory white took quite flak last week telling young black dress
david knows best overstepping bounds argued dictator david showing touch culture youthful fashion sense
allen iverson called dress code fake jason richardson stephen jackson thought racist paul pierce argued players businessmen entertainers duncan opined load crap basically retarded
regular season still weeks starting commissioner david stern edict managed transcend barrier separating much deeper racial cultural issues
first time phenomenon occurred last think bothers stern wrong
gotten dress policy preseason stern told espn surprise magic johnson mahmoud abdul rauf latrell sprewell allen iverson record accelerator actually live unscripted drama soap opera court court
world still considerable numbers people tend many things black white borderline extremists mental capacity shade things little gray folks every corner spectrum found something dave dictum worn athletes employed house stern built
rule covers players black white mixed race asian european south american caribbean canadian cuban mark players commentators took swipe younger black americans dominate player population
stern overseer billion year business said rule based something simple sinister
pressed buttons soft possibly could stern said explaining felt league getting increasingly younger money getting increasingly better generation players somehow become less aware predecessors expected conduct present public
coming year pacers pistons brawl palace defining moment regular season stern made dress code several initiatives aimed making players presentable public latch issue year average turn broader debate concerning society large
anything hold responsible sooner rather stern said hour long interview conference room next office league headquarters manhattan vast majority players issue
notion professional certain protocols dress business
players certainly offseason playing traveling affect feel free express corporate america expresses putting shorts sandals ratty shirt
pacers president larry bird said fielded comments fans clothes injured players wearing games fans simply wanted discuss merits player game offensive outfit provoked much negative feedback shirt shorts wearing next time casual friday
young black kids dress like players charles barkley said tonight show leno unfortunately paid like players real world wear held
well dressed white black wearing throwback jersey came interview hire white barkley said reality
without defensive stern defended discussing racial cultural ramifications dress code noting chuckle story seem tremendous legs journalism slang staying power
seemed epic public relations miscue early last week stern announcement million community outreach initiative buried beneath news commentary regarding dress code commissioner always spinning positive dress code brouhaha actually enabled mentions cares program otherwise would ignored mainstream media routinely ignores league outreach initiatives
certainly makes spectacular copy
majority players deal dress already sounds fair enough together
delicious issue
stern even shrugged word racist saying took offense half lifetime experience league office behind seen enough topics touch race related debates another long line
well things involve race whenever league significant percentage black things involve race going league like wnba women going gender issues dependent composition league difference involving race actions interpreted racist
surprised racism thrown debate
thrown issue raising entry issue absolutely positively basketball better players older experienced better business able look players year later
debate whether limit raised year prevent high school players jumping directly pros stern made social policy part debate said want young people including teens year olds urban america think becoming professional basketball player viable post high school employment option many impressionable youngsters thinking skills next lebron james
stern says thing never wanted viewed telling young person good
long mostly black league based predominantly white country issues involving race continue arise debate days palace brawl skewed toward ethnicity players throwing punches color fans receiving ends outrage crossed palpable preposterous infuriated commissioner
brawl sort became flashpoint feelings race always issue brawl unfairly became opportunity commentators talk players although involved brawl people thugs punks horrible sort libel slander players images context condemnation players really upset became critical flashpoint stern said
repairing league image discussed collective bargaining talks union agreed players sign autographs make appearances season ticket holder functions explore ways professionally adhering dress code

clippers chicago teams shot signing bryant away lakers free agent clips naturally last team lakers would want trade given share building well city bryant control future player would position trade clause

victories already last season tally perhaps time play twenty three questions bulls honor total well know
maybe
since bulls play seven questions instead chicago sixth extraordinaire gordon
tribute fact season bulls seventh since last championship might finally halts playoff drought
play seven questions even eddy curry welcomes curiosity
think natural response somebody watching team watching last five years curry said wonder good stretch going bulls finally guys really ready make next step
curry answer
team definitely real said think good stretch maybe three four turnaround think team definitely real
keep asking questions agree
guys thinking
initial response courtesy luol deng
tough league
though bulls swear upbeat team unprintable thoughts insist hard believe perhaps impossible chicago philosophical horrific start given circus comes united center every november forcing team start season killer road trip
upturn ironically started point loss dallas home total giveaway left chicago worse record games expansion charlotte somehow kiddies came away giveaway confidence believing least home could trouble anyone night dallas sixth straight opponent chicago held points bulls wound holding next opponents well stunningly rising league field goal defense
turned became clearer tuesday night bulls came back dallas rematch athleticism deep fleet kiddies chicago pulled away fourth quarter triumph perhaps bulls following night dropping decision houston falling overall west
believed said veteran forward antonio davis injured spectator mavericks even started felt like something going turn better situation
said deng team would worried know much surprise
right although bulls mark january would possible without favorable home heavy schedule excited play days
think people taking notice said forward tyson chandler smiling slyly
bulls without warning good defensively
time turn gordon ready response
coach skiles gordon said

gordon said
guys whatever skiles says
gordon said
seems revamped baby bulls much obedient used skiles explanation ability floyd bill cartwright failed
totally different team coach said something
skiles also tries keep schemes simple inexperience compromise effort getting dogged work defensively spite fact roster short veteran know argue bulls players younger second year point guard kirk hinrich ranking senior member group starts year deng
coach demands deng said want play play
result formed active hands unit allows opposition shoot percent field lowest league skiles deny misses days veteran laden team phoenix could introduce couple coverages morning shootaround know jason kidd could carry game night growing like simplicity
actually really surprised skiles said chicago defensive struggles november defended well camp right beginning days came giving points percent shooting fouling unbelievable rate really looked basically breaking every possession total team thing soon individual breakdowns started becoming good defensive team
youth going plus points game team offensively going take genius figure keep team upper probably trouble rookies close exceptional
skiles supposed screamer connected particular players
reason insiders skiles nearly screamer reputation suggests teacher screamer chicago
reason advantage many young guys opposed veterans less likely fire back demanding coach vets would
think curry said think reasons able turn around fast
curry careful clarify skiles hard nosed blunt legend harder probably explain curry said long pause tough really demands perfection team give
gordon echoed opinion putting skiles intensity class university connecticut coach calhoun
demanding demanding gets gordon said know exactly want confident teaching
gordon quickly adds thinks kind push something need career bull feels several young bulls come good programs respect coach ingrained early gordon uconn kirk hinrich kansas chris duhon deng duke even andres nocioni argentina gold medal winning national team draftees rarely stay college year experience players bring years best college systems undeniable plus
curry chandler meanwhile seem ready someone push right direction three lost seasons bashed much locally nationally lack development consistency willing absorb skiles tough love means continue rebound
inexperience really even though young guys mature ages davis said good kids worry young biggest thing really listening
bulls fans bulls management continue patient
fans amazingly patient patient bulls right expect sort dropoff understandable championships eight seasons bulls merely faded seasons since last title franchise posted cumulative record
patience shown general manager john paxson almost laudable widespread calls major shakeup bulls opened curry restricted free agent summer particular pretty unanimous choice first traded away
paxson held firm everywhere called paxson according league sources want lived curry growing pains moved time year blossom stance history supports since every jump directly high school pros eventually makes
somehow convinced curry mother agent demanded trade contract extension talks summer focus season
established early curry said
months later curry chandler forefront least front court nucleus rival envious roster paxson assembled recently prompted influential chicago times columnist mariotti regular espn around horn write paxson moved something amazing years removed famed clinching jumper phoenix finals
feel within organization past year half definitely turned couple corners skiles said moving right direction anything
want everybody wants want ring everyone trying came sort back game first becoming competitive team every night winning games point becoming playoff team take normally teams playoffs take lumps years make progress sometimes long long process
bulls start feeling pressure playoff berth expected
common sense says skiles concedes expectations raised magical january schedule working bulls three games stretch calls play away times span games
sure looked loose dallas especially crunch time might example remind good side inexperience oblivious pressure sometimes
also hurt east expected elite detroit miami indiana team elite present given indiana struggles
chicago holds
franchise past years whatever even playoff contention gordon said nothing lose
adds deng really disappointment chicago misses playoffs rebuilding team already shown building something
curry fans probably pretty disappointment time think happy effort knowing quote unquote stars team think people chicago recognize
bulls willing whatever takes sign curry chandler summer
biggie course feeling afford sign figures expensive hang onto seven footers restricted free agents bound attract money offer sheets road whatever curry chandler outcome undoubtedly impact chicago efforts sign hinrich deng gordon baby bulls come contracts


curry chandler want stay finally appear prospering fear course curry gain lost weight chandler never shake penchant injury money
risk great flourish elsewhere leave jermaine neal continue grow
skeptics note curry continues factor offensive rebounding either close lose weight contract year defense first chandler doubts ability stay healthy going away either
paxson though knows bulls recent history elton brand brad miller artest became stars chicago naturally prefer happen
eddy keep getting better said veteran swingman eric piatkowski even excited curry teammate houston playing alongside ming
young better keep telling people beast already
said curry feel tyson good franchise together things happen owners organizations tend look elsewhere winning season games likely stay
problem think good player fairly decent contract waiting next summer chicago somewhere else
chandler curry stressed however staying chicago shared first choice
especially curry said going hard times seeing like good times
halfway season safe team real
depends
players hesitation
definitely chandler said
believe deng said playoff team
skiles surprisingly bull downplay mode
starting bottom said worst overall records past several years starting take much everybody sort overhype everything
like direction headed like young guys tried focus play wins losses helped really rough spot fall back play
guys little success definitely possible letdown keep iron fist anything dealing young people human beings talk hoping success heads
good news
seem like kind people skiles contends
rather people think real chandler added people notice real tend spent little preparation time
