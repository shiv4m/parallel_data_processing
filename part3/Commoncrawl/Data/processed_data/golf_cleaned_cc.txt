main road town carnoustie bleak street framed gray sooty storefronts macadam narrow find jumping curb oncoming double decker rumble turn right ease skinny tunnel beneath dundee arbroath railway line right municipally owned carnoustie golf links equally bleak first glance
carnoustie championship course acknowledged toughest world perhaps toughest takes time savor appreciate
inland north visible hole course always exposed elements unlike firm fast sand based links carnoustie march direction backtrack inward nine holes change direction constantly face angle wind

writers designated villain royal ancient conducts open dictated setup course superintendent john philp accused putting noose carnoustie squeezing fairways footpaths deliberately cultivated jungle waist high cackling like demonic sorcerer

duncan official spokesman things says mistakes made year combination firm fairways high rough meant course perhaps difficult players went away unhappy certainly wanted duncan says certain elements probably unfair enough semi rough americans call narrow band primary rough balls fairways swallowed learned lesson meters semi rough along side every fairway time around
duncan wrong philp says bringing subject asking reporter told setup band semi rough width depth year purpose semi rough prevent ball rolling going thicker rough ball bouncing line bounces semi rough well sorry call green bonus golf
philp thinks brouhaha stems incidents single hole sixth made famous hogan wide fairway long split pair deep bunkers beyond forming avenues safe right hand fairway presents awkward second shot dunes jockie burn reach green dangerous left hand route lined bounds area along left flank presents much better angle green left corridor looks extremely narrow exacting yards first center bunker stakes corridor widens yards past second bunker hogan bravely drove avenue round open dubbed hogan alley

managed round included birdies bogies anything routine score looked like players made wakefield dealt golf balls wavering greens wind gusts wreaked havoc club selection mention wind burn

hate wind wakefield said nervous

survived earn shot claret









wakefield town called newcastle lyme located middle country manchester birmingham asked uncle taylor recurring theme press room visits star wicket keeper england would cricket

victory told might make famous sportsman family

achieved wakefield said think take years reach standard level

although wakefield attended opens royal birkdale never played course week interested game watched countryman nick faldo masters playoff scott hoch

challenge tour europe version nationwide tour added victory south africa dimension data shortly regaining european playing privileges qualifying tournament

augusta national course site epic collapse faldo shot flawless final overcome stroke deficit aided norman implosion

faldo needed prompting discuss delicate topic

know last time lead major holes faldo said claw back years happened augusta would phenomenal

time stroke lead perhaps also missing expectation norman local bookmaker ladbrokes start week norman odds shrunk along choi harrington however considered favorite

makes sense consider norman plays tennis bride chris evert golf admittedly came england expectations main goal ready next week british senior open royal troon scotland senior open later month

different scenario norman prime game marquee attraction expected every time teed talk norman disappointments majors continued often winning open championships finishing runner game biggest tournaments eight times

different question norman said players probably saying know played golf played successful golf

harrington last year open playoff sergio garcia ranked world prime career also shot nobody broke first major championship since final round open shinnecock

choi emerged game players rising world year seven tour victories never finished better third major would become first asian player major championship choi shot drop second round lead marveled norman

imaginative imaginative choi said

older faldo added much clever play funny impressive good touch especially testy greens come still putting stroke fairness life

faldo like many struggled come grips magnitude norman victory would mean

gone tiger woods talk greg comes like greg sneak radar love know little voice inside head saying beginning week

according norman saying much anything tried maintain expectation approach though holds shot lead game oldest tournament

long time said

faldo norman many times including open andrews dusted shark third round shared hole lead norman second open coming behind final round royal george clip faldo strokes

years later norman back away would surely golf greatest victories
