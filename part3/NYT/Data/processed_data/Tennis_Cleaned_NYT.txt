 difficult might remember time money stage tennis sport tiebreakers
 long every game margin theoretically finish line meant wimbledon first round singles great aging pancho gonzales defeated charlie pasarell score match lasted five hours minutes
 tiebreaker introduced grand slam tennis following year united states open flags flown courtside whenever reached
 taken years major tournaments reach awkward phase four different methods resolve deciding sets singles
 flags long gone novelty effect back australian open begins monday best point tiebreaker deciding sets third sets women fifth sets
 later year wimbledon introduce conventional best point tiebreaker leave french open grand slam tournament uses deciding tiebreaker singles
 think international tennis federation grand slams find less consistency rules understanding public forget french open tournament director said interview consistency mutual understanding seem particularly elusive fractious stage game
 grand slam leaders meet regularly usually made effort project unity last years tournaments grown prospered squabbled much often lately
 disputes possible introduction match coaching wimbledon leadership continues oppose disagreements laver team event australian open open formally backing
 seems symbolic australian open switch wilson dunlop four grand slam tournaments using balls manufactured different company year
 breaking ranks tiebreakers latest sign times even hardly seems major offense
 sports also lack consensus consider golf four majors four ways resolving ties leaderboard holes
 despite confusion fans still seem quite capable enjoying golf tennis fans surely feeling even tiebreakers sport great deal common golf playoffs
 tennis players best remain alert however
 format really said roger federer swiss superstar remains traditionalist fronts including match coaching funny thing different formats four different slams important remind fifth going remember
 women internal dialogue come third even little concern length grand slam women matches best three sets
 enjoying know score said angelique kerber lost taut australian open semifinal simona halep last year miss sure know good rule change
 wonders jimmy alen would think alen wealthy american pushed brisker innovative formats including tiebreaker alen former play died also driving forces creating international tennis hall fame newport
 alen would liked confusion different ways concluding matches four grand slam events said steve flink american tennis historian alen several times
 alen idea sudden death tiebreaker managed change game earnest best nine point duel winner take point decisive could give players match point simultaneously
 tiebreaker open adopted sets abandoned favor best point tiebreaker seemed players less lottery wimbledon embraced best point tiebreaker chose instead
 guess tennis always inexplicable inconsistencies formats scoring systems flink said
 wimbledon maintained scoring system opted tiebreakers waiting years adopting decisive tiebreaker last year semifinal kevin anderson john isner anderson finally fifth centre court disrupting tournament schedule
 know jimmy alen dismayed original sudden death nine point tiebreaker discarded flink said doubt would preferred australian open fifth tiebreaker wimbledon waiting fifth would suited

 osaka whose mother japanese father haitian american citizenship japan united states japanese dual citizens must choose nationalities time turn
 legal clause left fans commentators trying guess whether osaka pick citizenship japan country birth united states lived since young child
 choice facing osaka comes japan pressure loosen entrenched insularity japan long prized racial purity seeing largely homogeneous population crucial social cohesion country population declining employers increasingly desperate workers legislature passed december admit guest workers starting month
 osaka case along influx foreigners could exert pressure government begin bring japanese citizenship laws line roughly three quarters countries including united states allow dual citizenship
 though osaka decision make asked reporters nationality intended choose responded trademark feistiness
 pretty sure obvious said news conference following china open october playing japan disrespectful anything really conclusion hard choice anything comes
 still might hard imagine osaka giving american citizenship keep playing japanese flag reality legal experts japanese government rarely enforces requiring citizens choose nationalities
 justice ministry estimates japanese citizens also hold foreign passports government never revoked japanese citizenship anyone like osaka granted citizenship birth japanese citizens voluntarily naturalize another country automatically lose japanese citizenship
 analysts warn osaka celebrity would difficult government quietly give pass dual citizenship
 think government problem openly carries passports said sachiko horiguchi associate professor anthropology temple university tokyo campus means public would know really enforced think government wants admit public know
 three years renho murata whose father taiwan first woman lead opposition democratic party right wing critics attacked formally relinquished taiwanese citizenship

 osaka multicultural background challenged japan notions national identity become prominent mixed race mixed nationality figure country children born year foreign parent though fluent japanese captivated country whimsical remarks news media well humility victory
 parents decided young sister also played would represent japan partly american tennis federation showed little attention
 anticipating osaka citizenship choice michio ushioda former columnist mainichi shimbun daily newspaper professor teikyo university tokyo said twitter japan would fall national funk elected american citizenship japanese
 disappointment japanese time would great ushioda wrote tweet select followers could view even suggesting japan current administration would collapse osaka competed united states olympics
 international olympic committee rules competitors must nationals countries represent similarly international tennis federation rules osaka could play japan gave japanese citizenship
 legal experts japanese provides loophole dual citizens effectively retain nationalities requires japanese citizen renounce foreign nationality phrase provide enough wiggle room citizens hold extra passport
 people misunderstand feel threatened choose nationality said yasuhiro okuda professor chuo university
 japan granted citizenship children whose fathers japanese changed move made pressure international critics said rules discriminated women government added clause stipulating children dual citizenship would choose passports time turned
 analysts japan makes little sense modern world filled multicultural citizens like osaka
 goes japan efforts recruit retain global talent said erin chung professor east asian politics johns hopkins university baltimore basically maintain spirit current nationality huge deterrent athletes members called global talent pool stay japan
 older generations opening japan pool newly naturalized citizens could generate considerable political backlash
