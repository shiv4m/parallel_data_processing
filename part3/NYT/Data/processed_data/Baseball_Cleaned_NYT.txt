 best understand mike trout outfielder baseball angeles angels tuesday reportedly agreed richest contract north american sports perfect reflection sport
 little known many americans including sports fans trout best player game frequently mocked fading form entertainment primarily regional audiences
 baseball often dismissed less enticing believed bring billion annually even health safety issues baseball also called less dynamic even though billion less revenue last year
 trout year million contract revealed prompted obvious question could sport struggling attract generation fans facing potentially bruising labor fight players years afford another nine figure contract
 news trout deal came three weeks outfielder bryce harper accepted year million contract phillies month infielder manny machado year million deal diego padres
 comparison major league baseball players signed contracts least million
 answer mechanics collective bargaining agreement players owners anything might constitute referendum game popularity several dynamics work sport huge wealth still flows best best less money left called middle class despite continuing growth baseball revenues
 owners seems figured keep costs using younger players cheaper veterans thus freeing cash occasional megadeal players like trout harper machado benefit others forced accept less
 past teams valuing players differently said james paxton starting pitcher yankees long time system fine teams changed valuing players especially older players kind broken system forcing take look
 study published bradbury economics professor kennesaw state university calculated baseball revenue rose average rate percent player salaries rose average rate percent
 major league baseball revenues reached billion last year sources include evermore money guaranteed sources like multibillion dollar media deals entire sport lucrative media contracts many local level less important ticket sales generally fluctuate wins losses
 shift valuation players average salary went first time years little million according players association fourth time last years average gone
 halem deputy commissioner said evidence teams trying painted different picture baseball economics
 salaries gone average percent year since keeping pace baseball revenue growth time said slightly flat year make trend also said last decade players received consistent percentage game revenue percent
 market based system depending upon year clubs valuing players said halem players better others
 words like third rails sport especially ruinous strike regularly uttered players agents despite huge contracts
 focusing giant deals misses bigger picture according jeff borris longtime baseball agent represented stars like barry bonds general counsel ballengee group sports representation agency
 like trout harper aberrations borris said focus things like dallas keuchel signed contract gonzalez signed areas concern
 keuchel time star starting pitcher houston astros remained unsigned week opening gonzalez solid durable starting pitcher signed minor league deal yankees
 think owners manipulating system advantage borris said
 decades baseball players represented widely considered strongest union professional sports result baseball limits salaries though luxury penalizes team payroll rises million function facto
 problem least articulated players teams reward superstars longer feel compelled spend believe already pieces place compete championship
 interest players help teams particularly last weeks spring training tony clark executive director players association said trout deal reached
 despite baseball strong union certain provisions kept salaries rising decades turned norms hard fast rules
 baseball players become free agents accrue years service time generally paid league minimum first three seasons next three receive higher salaries negotiation arbitration leads situations like trout voted american league valuable player third full season earning million
 used acceptable players made back careers infamous albatross contracts given veterans like million extension signed ryan howard time veteran players paid fair wage slightly overpaid well sometimes
 coincidence trout harper machado megadeals younger circumstances older players like gonzalez keuchel demonstrate teams working assumption veteran abilities likely decline soon salary peaks makes sense younger players fill roster lower costs risks even chance make playoffs also reduced
 think thought teams sudden going stop competing degree said adam ottavino yankees pitcher things changed really fast

 wish scott boras lozano whatever agent would find make deal club sooner rather later negotiated system allows market operate
 boras represents outfielder bryce harper lozano represents infielder manny machado players years star selections still unsigned sunday dozens others nine jose bautista clay buchholz carlos gonzalez gonzalez marwin gonzalez dallas keuchel craig kimbrel jose iglesias denard span
 teams stopped spending like used free agent signed million winter starter patrick corbin year million deal washington nationals gone days player could year million contract like robinson cano seattle mariners season
 surprised cano traded mets december said sunday would every baseball player shocked
 manfred insisted instead suggested players recognize valued differently data driven industry less prone emotional decisions drove salaries ever higher
 think important remember major league baseball players association always wanted market based system markets change particularly institution around markets change manfred said change game people think players differently analyze players differently negotiate differently
 boston game highest payroll last season world series manfred cited tampa rays games budget translate crowds rays finished last american league attendance manfred said proved spending equate winning
 process putting together competitive team looks little different said used different process little faith people running clubs
 players frustrated teams choosing build young cheap labor proven veterans available money course calculus players used decades longer applies said nationals reliever sean doolittle bigger issue perceived flaws collective bargaining agreement
 biggest mistake think operating assumption norms always place going continue respected doolittle said friday always kind unspoken agreement model first years guys underpaid really much leverage locked minimum salary first three years arbitration process next three years market buyer much move value make back free agency
 players stopped short claiming outright collusion illegal tactic owners used suppress salaries many least suspicious groupthink taken industry adam wainwright highly respected veteran starter louis cardinals sounded alarm interview last week insidestl
 something changes going strike percent wainwright said think anybody hiding worried people going walk midseason
 baseball prolonged midseason strike devastating strike canceled world series first time years strike bled next season owners turned spring training farce fielding teams replacement players

 reflects fundamental misunderstanding conduct good labor relations people running around three years agreement expires word negotiation arguing going strike said
 actually degree labor relations never learned tactic really productive terms business think good fans think good players know going change outcome negotiations ultimately
 manfred would like negotiate field changes like second pitch clock used spring training games likely adopted regular season changes three batter minimum relief pitchers adoption designated hitter national league place season
 manfred would rather fans debate topics anything else really long dwell unsigned free agents

 port charlotte tangible sign cooperation commissioner office skeptical players association major league baseball union announced several rule changes thursday affect trading deadline star game roster size field strategy
 rules implemented demonstrate another winter many veteran free agents lingered months sluggish open market league players willing modify current collective bargaining agreement even though expire season
 good sides working together said infielder matt duffy union representative tampa rays good cooperation sides industry think creates healthy atmosphere industry game thrive
 players changes largely prelude complicated renegotiation financial aspects sides agreed discuss result immediate differences sport season including single trading deadline july
 read baseball debates rules players suggest trying harder
 rule eliminates archaic somewhat confusing process trade waivers years created second summer trading period players still placed claimed outright waivers july according rule traded date
 league also overhauled selection process star game starters added million pool bonus money home derby including million winner might enough motivate highly paid stars take part many young players million would dwarf annual salary
 engaged married said pete alonso slugging mets prospect would earn minimum makes team would definitely wedding costs
 star starters pitchers selected phases primary round designated first round fans vote starters position many years late june early july fans vote choosing three vote getters position initial round nine outfielders
 players receive bonuses finishing among vote getters position bonus pool players winning team increase star game goes extra innings inning beyond ninth begin runner second base players allowed enter game pinch runners
 changes season commissioner manfred goal speeding pace play average nine inning game took three hours last season five minutes still minutes longer average game
 pace play rules include pitch clock include reduction mound visits five time innings change remains reviewed holders broadcast rights breaks would reduced minutes regular season games minutes seconds local telecasts national telecasts
 significant changes begin rosters increase slot players august september though maximum roster size reduced
 games little outrageous times especially teams really competing postseason spot duffy said want give best chance game means bringing five relievers inning think going little realistic games september
 added reality percent season decided certain sudden important games everything flips completely little weird
 teams limit still determined number pitchers allowed active roster pitchers pitch minimum three batters half inning yankees reliever zack britton said players conflicted rule impose union agreeing challenge
 changes strategy sure britton said think nowadays many specialized pitchers righty lefty obviously guys limits role opportunity
 britton said addition roster spot effectively creates another union
 roster whole year adds bunch players going arbitration sooner free agency sooner britton said allows give players days especially adding position player bench
 many people baseball assumed would part last collective bargaining agreement went effect season kansas city royals team relies speed teams extra spot would make easier pinch runner roster
 example going carry terrance gore start season sure general manager dayton moore said last week referring player career stolen bases including postseason terrance made strides somebody could potentially utilized extra outfielder feel better
 changes also include restrictions position players pitching limiting appearances extra innings games pitcher team trails leads least runs injured list pitchers also returned days players since

 aroldis chapman nicknamed cuban missile reason yankees lanky left handed closer caribbean island long prominent face velocity explosion modern baseball ever since broke major leagues pitchers could match miles hour fastball
 last season month injured list left knee tendinitis sapped power average fastball speed dipped slightly previous season still among hardest throwers baseball first time since chapman tops louis cardinals relief pitcher jordan hicks nine years younger claimed title average according fangraphs
 problem chapman said spanish recently adding later anymore years pile choice
 eyebrows including injured inconsistent yankees understandably raised chapman began season albeit early april chill northeast throwing fastballs slow another potentially worrying issue yankees bullpen lived lofty expectations depleted roster general
 chapman concerned reason keeping past early season buildups speed ticked outing reaching ease recent appearances admittedly small sample size seven games average back entering friday night game kansas city royals
 work feel much better better well velocity pitches said chapman little people worry velocity worried
 average picks temperature innings ultimately settle
 chapman five time star still outlier given long held velocity continues aging even chapman thinks average entire season anymore want especially resurgence wipeout slider
 first years trying throw hard said years mentality starts changing objective throw hard pitch example tossing innings pitches possible throwing first pitch strikes every batter
 times last season chapman velocity hovered around larry rothschild yankees longtime pitching coach thought might norm
 numbers rothschild said warms gets still thrown fastballs high velocity point going little
 feels preposterous doubt whether enough many professional pitchers unable throw hard alone average entire month season many years average fastball baseball last season according fangraphs chapman freakishly athletic norm
 years gone back cuban missile good said many pitchers throwing hard maybe three pitchers throwing
 reach even starting pitchers chapman marveled hicks uncorked fastball game last matching chapman fastest pitch recorded baseball history hard throwers reached leagues chapman said
 even though chapman mitigated aging process bulking gangly foot frame continue lose power time fastball already induced fewer swings misses year lowest rates since start career
 still chapman pointed even fastballs would enough succeed majors long still gets outs outings season entering friday mostly allowing runs taking loss striking nine walking
 helped chapman already slider departing free agency last season reliever david robertson helped chapman tweak grip slider sharper movement proved successful second half
 chapman used slider career high percent time last season partly yankees urging opponents whiffed percent time swung highest rate slider among relief pitchers baseball last season according baseball prospectus
 season third chapman five year million deal yankees using slider even percent time entering friday said never felt better
 slider pitch still electric stuff think long wants healthy gives pitch going give longevity yankees manager aaron boone said last month adding later really impressed last year started times able strike pitch better fastball
 chapman trademark pitch feeble seeing fastballs chapman ninth inning april game baltimore orioles outfielder trey mancini struck offering middle plate
 seemed even harder mancini said thought probably test still electric pitch really tall releases ball seems like right
 days mancini three sliders chapman lining final
 people know slider pretty darn good pitch mancini said anything like slider still going make fastball look really hard even slightly less hard used

 brooklyn dodgers friend trip louis early season preacher slender lefty retired west plains entertained former teammates chase hotel needed advice
 around table talking preacher recalls carl erskine dodgers starter said want question sports illustrated offered tell threw spitter think blacktop driveway house could really think
 guys said ahead preach sure admired preacher great study watch pitch clever games really pitcher pitcher leaving dining room preacher said hear speak said preacher outstanding pitcher without spitter hate taint whole career talking throwing
 anyway preacher article sometime later talked preach said know ruined chances hall fame admitting threw spitter advised said preacher pitch pitcher pitcher could without spitter
 maybe maybe erskine believed confession said turned pitch slumping pirates reviving spitter practiced harry brecheen cardinals farmhand last chance made becoming regular star though quite cooperstown candidate dodgers cheating made sense
 told dick young sports illustrated article decided pitch caught told kick anyway lose
 lose often much winning percentage seven seasons brooklyn guessed spitter earned bench innings would stick beech mouth announce going batch curveballs game spit meaty part thumb pretending wipe brow hitching belt subtly wipe index middle fingers saliva fingers thumb underneath ready compared squeezing peach watermelon seed fingertips
 idea part grip said ball leaves hand slips fingers clings tiny like part thumb ball jumps account good drops like dead duck crosses plate
 confession confirmed reputation stan musial wrote decades later always first pitch hitting strikes usually load hated shower anticipation spitter helped knew destroy evidence never caught
 umpire would call ball preacher would stomp around look hand like probably time erskine says instead tossing ball roll umpire ground
 like steroid users decades later stayed ahead cops thrived pang regret erskine least going public bursting cloud mystery showed knew done specter dark arts would indeed follow grave died word appeared headline york times obituary
 chaotic decades spitball banned year country went prohibition rule simply turned mound speakeasy many pitchers going undercover slippery edge predecessors
 physics behind spitball simple enough ball slides fingers loses backspin therefore rotates less something like knuckleball rotate forkball tumbling final plunge
 defacing surface ball produces kind effect added movement opposite side scuff also dates game early days imagine baseballs looked like early century
 play whole game ball stayed park wahoo crawford hall famer played says glory times book lawrence ritter
 black full tobacco licorice stains crawford continues pitchers used back
 even possibility scuffing gives pitchers edge words come chet brewer star kansas city monarchs negro national league late sound timeless
 ball credit told john holway book diamonds picked rough throw game exactly cuts could pitch
 scuffing charges never dogged mike mussina hall fame right hander orioles yankees like smart pitcher would never reject ball came mark mussina order every catcher ball scrapes ground never volunteer umpire
 hits ground ball short throw back first base soon grab ball running thumb mussina says holding ball referring white area within horseshoe sinker ball find think pretty good flip side scuffed wrong side
 means opposite side horseshoe areas scuffed counteract advantage scuff seams narrow sweet spot creates four seam sinker pitch spins like straight fastball veers away direction opposite scuff
 common lament among retired pitchers many balls thrown play underscores lack craftsmanship mound
 literally seen teammates scuff ball says jamie moyer games career ended year turned funny stuff minute funny stuff benefit
 hitters conditioned umpires discard ball skips umpires catchers know catchers tend almost reflexive response spear ball dirt transfer quickly throwing hand hold keep reject
 course fielders still create scuff catchers deliberately short throws innings outfielders routine throws infield times changed
 played ball dirt still play says chili davis mets hitting coach played game catcher throws ball second short ball gets blocked dirt ball game automatic
 pitchers also seek ways look natural applying moisture tackiness fingers former player broadcaster reached team ball pulled canister colorless skin spray helps secure athletic tape spritz skin invisible island instant tackiness fingers
 also pitchers like putting clear bullfrog sunscreen arms grab rosin aimlessly touch bullfrog spot enough stickiness help guide pitches catcher says seen pitchers leave dugout innings wrap fingers around ball coated pine leaving enough residue hands better grip return mound
 next time game notice surfaces pitcher touches hand pitchers fidgety creatures constantly tugging swiping scratching caps sleeves skin something corey kluber time young award winner cleveland grabs tongue mound every pitch became legal years wipes hand side pants
 balls advance kluber says rubbed bucket dust stuff slippery little moisture hand least still wipe obviously little moisture hand ball
 kluber matter weather tactics especially handy cold high altitude harder generate moisture
 tell says year veteran could camera behind dugout colorado would like scientist laboratory people anything find grip
 players even hitters tend accept practice pitch instrument destruction hitter would rather pitcher know going accidentally fire ball head fine distinction sure logic tackiness helps command finish pitch sandpaper jelly helps enhance movement
 cold weather minnesota something grip curveball says kaat starred twins years lobbied hitters pine grip better help farther able pine
 comes back discretion yankees michael pineda brazenly smeared pine neck chilly night fenway park overt felt compelled object pineda game suspension widespread ridicule generally long pitcher discreet side problem pine

 scoundrels gone

 looking sutton sink make ball move plesac says velocity pitch anymore many guys many real power pitchers need scuff ball successful many need stuff good
 plesac works network founded baseball vast ever expanding visual empire every watch games every team bank video screens usually dugout showing every conceivable angle replays analysis good luck evading sophisticated alarm system baseball history
 many cameras hard away says jason giambi played seasons majors many sets eyes guys especially pitch looks really abnormal team video analyst rewinds times different went side pants went belt went start together timeline every time pitched ball thing last start start know right tell umpire check check side pants check inside glove hide anymore

 ronald acuna years days played games major league level season reached career home runs tuesday atlanta braves agreed contract locks eight years record price player million
 braves ridiculous sound almost assuredly bargain
 contract acuna carry season includes team options could keep atlanta continued trend spring players seemingly wary slowing free agent market signing extensions teams earlier usual players lock large payday relatively young postpone entry free agency process decades considered best maximize career earnings
 mike trout prominent player sign huge extension season agreeing million extension angels years become free agent nolan arenado supposed jewel next year free agent class signed million extension colorado instead chris sale million boston jacob degrom million mets paul goldschmidt million louis alex bregman million houston
 nine figure deals
 extension spree seem like baseball lavishing players cash clubs wary enormous free agent deals like ones signed bryce harper manny machado season save money long lock players early reach free agency maximize payday players unwilling endure years lower process harper machado went agreeing take less overall money exchange dose security
 seems especially relevant case acuna outfielder already done much young players easily compared harper machado
 last year rookie year award winning campaign acuna accounted wins replacement year despite playing games going back john mcgraw position players younger recorded season figure least according baseball reference group includes hall famers three players trout harper machado hall fame track alex rodriguez player complicated hall fame case becomes eligible certainly hall fame numbers
 members group claudell washington outfielder several teams dick hoblitzell first baseman cincinnati boston early century failed live early promise jason heyward despite sensational fell latter half
 even accounting limitations washington hoblitzell mixed results heyward remains relatively solid decision gamble players stars especially considering potential savings braves
 acuna eschewed extension traditional path likely would spent season next earning near major league minimum would entered baseball arbitration process likely could commanded million first year million second year million third year would free agent presumably setting deal worth million year
 realistically acuna might cost million lifetime deal another million considering million team options team exercise eight years also unlikely open market turning players become much less likely receive lengthy high dollar contracts
 plenty reasons celebrate deal acuna braves player organization since gets paid instead waiting payday road atlanta secured face franchise much player prime braves upshot includes healthy savings long
