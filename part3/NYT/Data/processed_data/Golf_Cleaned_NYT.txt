 many consumers fall love golf community home melton said realize afterward thrilled area
 also consider whether near quality medical care international airport noteworthy restaurants arts culture scene priority
 home could tick boxes terms looking hour drive major grocery store hospital could hassle melton said
 forget weather destinations cold play golf spend time outdoors winter rainy hurricane season others almost summer said rowlinson editor place magazine division british based real estate consulting brand name
 want play golf year round want home appealing year round look property located region stable climate save maybe months said
 location also means exact position home rowlinson said
 right next green fairway sounds idyllic early morning mowers noisy sprinklers come night fast moving golf balls landing pool tiresome said
 bottom line sensitive noise crack shot drives louder murmur greenside putts
 similarly like views across fairways happy golfers staring home pass strategically placed line bushes provide privacy
 avid golfer number good courses nearby figure playing club week week dull
 want least public courses less hour drive option variety play rowlinson said

 find experienced broker
 often buyers interested golf communities usually work brokers well informed areas looking said blake plumley chief executive capital pursuits development consulting firm specializing resort residential communities interviewing potential brokers many properties sold communities ideally several
 also inquire three positive aspects three drawbacks living communities broker able easily answer plumley said
 broker personally know golf club membership director general manager head golf figures communities want broker directly introduce people plumley said

 look amenities
 successful golf communities offer much golf much likely attract plenty nongolfing residents rowlinson said
 desirable amenities include clubhouse social gathering space tennis courts outdoor pool grill area high quality restaurant casual dining option family friendly club also important best communities robust lineup activities children families summer camps boating hiking excursions pool days food themed dinners taco night
 amenities community broader appeal making home sellable ever look move melton said

 understand financial commitments
 living golf development comes additional costs could include club dues property taxes monthly maintenance fees costs vary greatly community next home considering might affordable price living community could exorbitant
 also communities assess residents others means residents billed cost projects health club repairing clubhouse leaky roof financially sound communities healthy cash reserve projects exact number varies depending community size scale amenities according plumley communities limited money reserve broker able give information

 willing play rules
 golf communities regulations residents expected follow melton said buyers sure understand rules decide whether comfortable abiding
 significant rules whether residents required members golf club whether golfer smarter move live community required member otherwise look resell potential buyer base limited
 interested becoming member know signing ever move need give membership example required dues someone take could take years

 also communities design guidelines want make sure aesthetic matches example likely allowed build deco home community properties built contemporary style

 golf course protected
 chance community golf course closing homes structures built
 real estate agent find cases golf course protected owner conservation easement deed restriction stating land never anything course courses protected means owners right close
 communities golf course protected property potential lose percent value plumley said
