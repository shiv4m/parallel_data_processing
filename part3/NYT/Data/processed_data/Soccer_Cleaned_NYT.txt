 wednesday obviously lionel messi scoring twice creating twice orchestrating barcelona demolition courageous fearless utterly outgunned lyon
 french visitor discomfited barcelona gentle draft change quite full wind lyon defended valiantly counterattacked zest barcelona broke deadlock messi penalty deftly almost thoughtlessly chipped past anthony lopes
 minutes second half lyon hope lucas tousart made single strike bounce ball would enough barcelona list giants toppled season last long messi soon snatched away
 second goal delicate shot mazy dribbles ball seems fall completely hopelessly spell effectively killed game assists gerard piqu ousmane demb helped victory bleed rout
 stood makes messi captivating killer blows count jabs thrusts parries watching dance around skip ghost away tackles precision passing unerring ability make right choice messi rarely tries spectacular unlikely abuse status talent makes sure everything almost everything right gift always simplicity fading
 eras times change identifying exact science course tend drift rarely clean breaks perhaps fair real madrid period dominance superclubs hiatus even spain eminence european competition every champions league title since last
 equally possible none eras existed first place instead simply consequences messi ronaldo teams beneficiaries greatness ability decide games define seasons changed everything might look different messi ronaldo though still

 made women stark departure team prioritized stability guaranteed also means single poor performance stings used even helps ellis collect valuable insight

 since pochettino took charge team manchester city points premier league twice tottenham mounted sustained challenges first english championship since season managed cling coattails city liverpool points stage season handful teams history

 dortmund germany told marcel schmelzer must spent hours scouring video searching sort tell kind clue
 schmelzer borussia dortmund long serving left back performed ritual times last decade building unparalleled expertise field pored countless clips hoping find something anything would give little advance warning head start
 tried find pattern said thus though drawn blank even years even hours study even games defender knows arjen robben better anyone else still work exactly going inside
 outside seem predictable players world soccer robben performed calling card often since first joined bayern munich years bears name germany also france cutting right wing shoot left foot known robben player acknowledged last month proud move
 remarkable though maneuver lost none power surprise appears retain capacity surprise
 robben deep final season munich make final appearance champions league club week bayern prove unable past liverpool delicately poised last wednesday munich allianz arena
 time germany impressively successful straight bundesliga titles slew domestic cups scored winning goal champions league final also admirably long robben years since mourinho first signed chelsea since joined real madrid
 remains though integral part soccer great powers winger genuine menace silken touch searing speed lionel messi cristiano ronaldo leading robben among prominent members supporting cast instantly recognizable fixture game exalted stage signature move regular feature latter rounds champions league
 familiar barely needs description robben sprints right wing outstretched balance head pulled back legs whirring approaches penalty area feints right drops shoulder shift weight slip left ball never leaves control opponent left grasping shadows
 robben glances curls shot across goalkeeper always course frequently enough schmelzer spent considerable time trying work stop
 though comes puzzle robben cutting left years intent apparent defenders know exactly mind precisely coming remain powerless stop
 robben factors explain continued success timing said interview handful british newspapers last month right time still surprises variation previously suggested equally important thing without variation work said never pass dribble outside cutting inside stop working
 schmelzer deal robben direct face face competition opponent something else however noticed robben leaned heavily favored move recent years using wing decoy path center still works though block path reacts accordingly makes special
 ability improvise ricardo rodriguez identified rodriguez swiss defender milan knows robben almost well schmelzer according gracenote sports faced times career time wolfsburg zurich
 fast especially ball rodriguez said makes difficult stop terribly fast cuts inside stop stay close hurt time
 reason cognitive scientist named shanti ganesh based radboud university netherlands conducted study robben movement determined robben moves little faster conscious knowledge defender brain ganesh said unconsciously follows robben feints even knows deep feints time takes rectify error robben always going everyone involved knew going inside taken shot player still correct ganesh said always fraction late
 theory chimes empirical study conducted wendell brazilian left back bayer leverkusen faced robben times since moving germany behind schmelzer rodriguez
 move also move tired seeing running getting ball said must something maybe waits last moment know time wait move bigger chance getting ball back take time chance dribble past
 like schmelzer wendell spent time might like watching clips robben like schmelzer remembers training sessions days leading games bayern team worked defend danger dealt collectively
 dortmund always approach need teammates back schmelzer said honest simply possible take match full minutes xbcrgen klopp always taught problem losing duel covering
 schmelzer decided tackle relied central defender mats hummels defensive midfielder sven bender scurry across support always enough robben acting alone could always call threat philipp lahm later joshua kimmich streaking right wing collect ball overlap schmelzer conscious
 working inside merely decoy always challenge even years opponents tell move coming seen somehow every time feels like first time study tapes stay close call backup
 none works wendell said last resort ball back said commit foul fails often skips away quickly disappears flash arjen robben years always cuts inside
